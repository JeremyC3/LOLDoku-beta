## Game Rules

üü¢ The goal of the game is to fill in all 9 boxes with the correct League of Legends champion!

‚ù§Ô∏è You have to do so with only 9 guesses so choose wisely.

üëÄ Once you select a champion, you can't switch your answer or reuse that champion.

üòé Your uniqueness score is all of your answer's percentages added up. The percentages show you how many players put the same correct answer as you. The lower the score, the better!

## Scripts

The `scripts` section of the `package.json` file define various commands to streamline development and deployment processes. The following is an overview of each script:

- `"dev"`
  For development purposes. Compiles TypeScript code and concurrently runs Vite dev server for front-end and Nodemon for back-end. Allows for real-time reloading during development.

- `"start"`
  Used for running application in production-like environment. Compiles TypeScript code and starts server using Nodemon, which will automatically restart server if any changes are detected in server files.

- `"build"`
  Triggers Vite build process for front-end application. Compiles and bundles React application into static files optimized for production.

- `"build`
  Runs TypeScript compiler in watch mode, continuously monitoring for any changes in `.ts/.tsx` files and recompiles them as needed. Useful during development for immediate feedback on code changes.

- `"preview"`
  Locally preview production build of front-end application. Serves static files generated by Vite build command, allowing local testing of production build before deployment.
