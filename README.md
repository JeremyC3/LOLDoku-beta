## Description
* The goal of the game is to fill in all 9 boxes with the correct League of Legends champions!
* You have to do so with only 9 guesses so choose wisely!
* Once you select a champion, you can't switch your answer or reuse that champion.
* When a specific region is a category, you need to select a champion that is associated with that region.
* We base our categories off the main League of Legends Champions.
